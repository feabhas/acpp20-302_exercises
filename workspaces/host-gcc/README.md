# Feabhas CMake Project Notes

# Basic Usage

The Feahbas project build process uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as the underlying
build system. CMake is itself a build system generator and we have configured
it to generate the build files used by [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

Using CMake is a two step process: generate build files and then build. To simplify 
this and to allow you to add additional source and header files we have 
created a front end script to automate the build.

You can add additional C/C++ source and header files to the `src` directory. If 
you prefer you can place your header files in the `include` directory.

## To build the application

From within VS Code you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Shift-B` 
to run one of the build tasks:
    * **Build** standard build
    * **Clean** to remove object and executable files
    * **Reset** to regenerate the CMake build files

To run the application use `Ctrl-Shift-P` shortcut key, enter test in 
the search field and then select `Tasks: Run Test Task` from the list of tasks shown. 
The next time you use `Ctrl-Shift-P` the `Tasks: Run Test Task` will be at the top of the list. 

Run tasks are project specific. For the host:
    * **Run Application** to run the built executable
    
From the command line at the project root do:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

This will generate the file `build/debug/Application`.

You can add a `-v` option see the underlying build commands:

```
$ ./build.sh -v
```

The `build.sh` script supports the `--help` option for more information.

## To clean the build

To delete all object files and recompile the complete project use
the `clean` option:

```
$ ./build.sh clean
```

To clean the entire build directory and regenerate a new build configuration use
the `reset` option:

```
$ ./build.sh reset
```

## VS Debug

To debug your code with the interactive (visual) debugger press the `<F5>` key or use the
**Run -> Start Debugging** menu.

The debug sessions with stop at the entry to the `main` function and may display a 
red error box saying:

```
Exception has occured.
```

This is normal: just close the warning popup and use the debug icon commands at the top 
manage the debug system. The icons are (from left to right):
  **continue**, **stop over**, **step into**, **step return**, **restart** and **quit**

# Building an exercise solution

To build any of the exercise solutions run the script:
```
$ ./build-one.sh N 
```
where `N` is the exercise number.

**NOTE:** this will copy all files in the `src` directory to the `src.bak` directory having
removed any files already present in `src.bak`.

The `build-one.sh` script supports the `--help` option for more information.

Do not use the `--all` option as this will build each solution in turn and is used
as part of our Continuous Integration testing.

# C/C++ Versions

The build system supports compiling against different versions of C and C++ with the 
default set in `MakeLists.txt` as C11 and C++17. The `build.sh` and `build-one.sh` scripts
accept a version option to choose a different language option. To compile against C99 add 
the optiuon `--c99 (or --C99) or for C++20 add --cpp20 (or --c++20 --C++20 --CPP20).

# C++20 Modules

Support for compiling C++ modules is enabled by creating a file `Modules.txt` in the
`src` folder and defining each module filename on a separate line in this file. The build 
ensures modules are compiled in the order defined in the `Modules.txt` file and before the 
main `src` files. Following MSVC and VS Code conventions the modules should be defined 
in `*.ixx` files.
